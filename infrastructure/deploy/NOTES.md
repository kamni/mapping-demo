# Notes

(Because we can't put comments in yaml files...)

The `docker-compose.yml` file is based off of
[this tutorial](https://londonappdeveloper.com/how-to-use-terraform-via-docker-compose-for-professional-developers/).

The purpose of the docker-compose file is to allow us to bootstrap
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) without needing to install it locally.
Using Terraform through Docker ensures a consistent deploy experience that
should work across all machines.
